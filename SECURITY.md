# Security Policy

## Introduction

At Devoter, we take the security of our software seriously. This security policy outlines our approach to handling security vulnerabilities in the devoter-app repository and related projects. We are committed to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of our software. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest supported version to receive ongoing security patches.

| Version | Supported        |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 1.x     | ✅ Supported     |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not Supported |

If you are using an unsupported version, we recommend upgrading as soon as possible to mitigate potential security risks.

## Security Updates

When a security vulnerability is identified and confirmed, we will:

1. Develop and test a fix.
2. Release a security advisory with details about the vulnerability, its impact, and mitigation steps.
3. Provide patches or updates for supported versions.
4. Coordinate disclosure with the reporter, if applicable.

Security updates will be released as soon as possible, typically within 30 days of confirmation, depending on the severity and complexity of the issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us responsibly. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure environment.
